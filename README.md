# Turbofan Engine Degradation - NASA Prognostics Center of Excellence
## The challenge
This repository presents a Data Science project developed to analyse Turbofan Engines and predict its degration. The time series dataset provides measurements of numerous engines simulated experimentally until its failure. The data was provided by the [Prognostics Center of Excellence Data Set Repository] (https://www.nasa.gov/content/prognostics-center-of-excellence-data-set-repository).

The main goal is to develop a model capable of predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of each machine based on the sensors measurements.

## Results
By the end, it was possible to identify the influence and correlation of each sensor with the engine degradation. Also, the model developed has a XX 
The development is presentened on the following notebooks:
- `1-data_cleaning_and_EDA`: preliminar study and manipulation of the dataset. Exploratory Data Analysis;
    - (Pandas) (Seaborn)
- `2-feat_engineering_and_modelling`: feature engineering, model building and optmization.
    - (Sklearn) (Bayesian optmization)
